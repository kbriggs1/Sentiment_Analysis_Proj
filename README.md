# Sentiment_Analysis_Proj

# Purpose: 

Setiment Analysis focuses on determining the sentiment of a particular topic discusses in a language. The majority of previous sentiment analysis used were on topics that discussed customer service reviews and nothing from the clinical domain. There are different contexts in which sentiment can be analyzed from. For instance, sentiment from the customer review perspective would look very different from a clinical narrative perspective. Therefore the purpose of this project is to perform a preliminary exploratory sentiment analysis on 6/1,304 clinical narratives extracted from the 2014 De-Identification longitudinal data corpus from Harvard University's medical study that analyzed predictive risk factors of Cardiac Artery Disease in diabetic patients.
